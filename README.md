================

An in-development web browser coded completely in C#. Not done yet -  at all - 
so check back in a few months/years. It'll either be abandoned or be awesome.

hehe manifestos

The goal of the Aperture web browser is to follow [the WHATWG HTML spec][] as 
closely as possible. All algorithms and parsing steps should be written as is 
written in the specification.
